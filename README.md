# C.R.U.D.


## Overview

We are going to have you create a CRUD application, completely from scratch.The goal here is to get comfortable with building a web app, not persisting the data. We can however use the DAO pattern to mimic the functionality of a database, and implement a simple form of file persistence.

## The Application

The goal here is to have you implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which is some of the most common behavior on the web. It represents the states of persistence that almost every application has (further reading for those interested). Usually CRUD is associated with a database, but we don't want you worrying about one of those, so we are just going to use an array or map for persistence, and save its contents to a file.

Your application should adhere to the MVC pattern. Benefits of the MVC pattern is similar to that of encapsulation. There is a separation of concerns between the individual elements that make up the model, view, and controller respectively. Changing code in one has no affect on the code in the others. Their interactions are discussed below.
