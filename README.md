# C.R.U.D.
### Created By: Jimmy Easter

## Overview

The goal here was to implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete), which is some of the most common behavior on the web. It represents the states of persistence that almost every application has (further reading for those interested). Usually CRUD is associated with a database, but we don't want you worrying about one of those, so we are just going to use an array or map for persistence, and save its contents to a file.

## The Application

This application should adheres to the MVC pattern. Benefits of the MVC pattern is similar to that of encapsulation. There is a separation of concerns between the individual elements that make up the model, view, and controller respectively. Changing code in one has no affect on the code in the others. Their interactions are discussed below.


Technologies Used:

	-Java
	-Spring MVC
	-Gradle
	-HTML/CSS
	
This was coded using the Spring framework and JSPs to minimize repetitive coding. Given enough time, I'd like to add JUnit tests to ensure session data is working properly.

The biggest stumbling blocks I encountered dealt with learning the Spring framework - something I now feel I have a better handle of!
